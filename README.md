## Requirements

If you are using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), navigating to the project root directory and running `poetry install` will suffice. Otherwise, a `requirements.txt` file is present so you can install all dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. However, if you just want to download the trained models or dataset splits, make sure to have [gdown](https://github.com/wkentaro/gdown) installed. If the project dependencies are installed then `gdown` is already present. Otherwise, run `pip install gdown` to install it.
